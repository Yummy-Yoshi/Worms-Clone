# Worms Clone

Worms is a classic game where several teams of worms use a variety of weaponry
to elimiate each other from a randomly generated terrain.

This code is meant to be a small clone of the game built using a pre-built game engine
in C++.

This project aims to further develop and demonstrate my skills in C++ and Object-Oriented Programming.

## Run Locally
Clone the project
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Yummy-Yoshi/Worms-Clone
```
Using Microsoft Visual Studio, run the project using the Local Windows Debugger

## Acknowledgements
This project leverages Javidx9's Pixel Game Engine and implements concepts learned from his guides.
